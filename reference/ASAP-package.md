# ASAP: Automated Sound Analysis Pipeline for Avian Vocalization Research

A comprehensive toolkit for longitudinal analysis of birdsong
development. ASAP provides an integrated suite of tools for processing,
analyzing, and visualizing avian vocalizations, with particular emphasis
on zebra finch song recordings from SAP2011. The package implements
automated workflows for bout detection, motif extraction, syllable
segmentation, template matching, temporal and spectral feature
extraction, enabling researchers to track subtle changes in vocal
patterns across developmental time points. Through efficient parallel
processing and standardized analytical approaches, ASAP facilitates
large-scale longitudinal studies of song learning and development,
offering researchers powerful tools for quantifying vocal plasticity and
investigating the mechanisms of vocal learning in songbirds.
