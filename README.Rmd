## Overview

ASAP (Automated Sound Analysis Pipeline) is a comprehensive R toolkit designed for longitudinal analysis of birdsong development, with particular emphasis on zebra finch vocalizations recorded using SAP2011.

## Key Features

-   **Automated Song Analysis**
    -   Bout detection
    -   Motif extraction
    -   Syllable segmentation
    -   Template matching
    -   Feature extraction (temporal & spectral)
-   **Advanced Processing**
    -   Standardized analytical workflows
    -   Large-scale data handling
    -   Longitudinal tracking
    -   Parallel processing support

## Purpose

ASAP facilitates large-scale longitudinal studies of song development by: - üìä Processing and analyzing complex vocal patterns - üîç Detecting and visualizing feature changes in high-dimensional acoustic space - üß¨ Providing white-box algorithms for investigating song evolution in latent space

## Installation

To install ASAP, I recommend using remotes:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
require(remotes)
remotes::install_github("LXiao06/ASAP")
```

## Example

This example demonstrates how to detect bout boundaries or syllable segmentation from a single zebra finch song sample (WAV file).

```{r example,echo = FALSE}
library(ASAP)
# Set up 1 row, 2 columns layout
par(mfrow=c(1,2)) 

# Get path to example WAV file
wav_file <- system.file("extdata", "zf_example.wav", package = "ASAP")
  
# Find bout
bouts <- find_bout(wav_file, rms_threshold= 0.1, min_duration = 0.7)

# Segmentation 
syllables <- segment(wav_file, start_time = 1, end_time = 5,
                 flim = c(1, 8), silence_threshold = 0.01,
                 min_syllable_ms = 20, max_syllable_ms = 240, min_level_db = 10)

  
```

This example demonstrates the automated song development analysis. Using the SAP object, which is constructed and optimized for SAP2011 recordings, we track and visualize motif changes over time through heatmaps and latent space projections.

```{r,example-code, eval = FALSE}
# Create sap object 
sap <- create_sap_object(
  base_path = "/path/to/your/wav/file/directory",
  subfolders_to_include = c("190", "201", "203"),
  labels = c("BL", "Post", "Rec")
)

# A standardized pipeline for motif analysis
sap <- sap |>
  create_audio_clip(indices = 1, start_time = 1, end_time = 2.5,
                    clip_names = "m1") |>
  create_template(template_name = "d", clip_name = "m1",
                  start_time = 0.72,   end_time =  0.84,
                  freq_min = 1,  freq_max = 10,
                  threshold = 0.5, write_template = TRUE) |>
  detect_template(template_name = "d") |>
  find_motif(template_name = "d", pre_time = 0.7, lag_time = 0.5) |>
  analyze_spectral(balanced = TRUE) |>
  find_clusters() |>
  run_umap() |>
  create_trajectory_matrix(data_type = "feat.embeds", clusters = c(0, 1),
                           balanced = TRUE) |>
  run_pca()  |>
  run_umap(data_type = "traj_mat", min_dist = 0.5)


# Visualization
sap <- sap |>
  plot_heatmap(balanced = TRUE, ordered = TRUE)|>
  plot_umap(split.by = "label") |>
  plot_umap2(data_type = "traj.embeds", overlay_mode = TRUE, 
             base_label = "BL", compare_labels ="Rec")

```

```{r example-plots, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("man/figures/sap_analysis.png")
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
