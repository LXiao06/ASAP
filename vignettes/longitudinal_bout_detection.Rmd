## Introduction

This vignette demonstrates how to detect and analyze song bouts across 
**longitudinal recordings** using SAP objects. Bout detection identifies 
continuous periods of vocalization, which is essential for understanding 
song production patterns during development.

**Prerequisites**: Before reading this vignette, we recommend completing:

- [Overview: Basic Audio Analysis](single_wav_analysis.html) - Core ASAP functions
- [Constructing SAP Object](construct_sap_object.html) - SAP object creation
- [Longitudinal Motif Detection](longitudinal_motif_detection.html) - Motif-based workflow

## Overview

**What are bouts?** Song bouts are continuous periods of vocalization separated 
by silence. In zebra finches, a bout typically contains multiple motif renditions 
and provides important context for understanding song structure and production.

**Why detect bouts?** Bout-level analysis enables:

- Tracking song production rate across development
- Analyzing bout duration and structure changes
- Understanding motif density within bouts
- Identifying practice patterns and song maturation

**Relationship to motif detection**: While motif detection identifies specific, 
repeatable vocal sequences, bout detection captures the broader temporal structure of 
vocalization. When used together (with `summary = TRUE`), you can analyze 
how motifs are organized within bouts across developmental time points.

## Complete Pipeline

The bout detection workflow processes all recordings in a SAP object to identify 
bouts across multiple time points.

### Option 1: Load SAP Object from Previous Analysis

If you've already completed motif detection (see [Longitudinal Motif Detection](longitudinal_motif_detection.html)), 
you can load that SAP object and add bout detection:

```{r pipeline-load, eval = FALSE}
library(ASAP)

# Load SAP object from previous motif detection vignette
sap <- readRDS("longitudinal_motif_analysis.rds")

# Add bout detection with motif-bout relationships
sap <- sap |>
  find_bout(
    rms_threshold = 0.1,
    min_duration = 0.4,
    gap_duration = 0.3,
    freq_range = c(3, 5),
    summary = TRUE  # Include motif-bout relationships
  )

# Visualize results
plot_heatmap(sap, segment_type = "bouts", balanced = TRUE)
```

### Option 2: Create New SAP Object

Alternatively, you can create a new SAP object from scratch (see [Constructing SAP Object](construct_sap_object.html) 
for detailed instructions):

```{r pipeline-create, eval = FALSE}
library(ASAP)

# Create SAP object
sap <- create_sap_object(
  base_path = "/path/to/recordings",
  subfolders_to_include = c("190", "201", "203"),
  labels = c("BL", "Post", "Rec")
)

# Detect bouts across all recordings
sap <- sap |>
  find_bout(
    rms_threshold = 0.1,
    min_duration = 0.4,
    gap_duration = 0.3,
    freq_range = c(3, 5)
  )
```

**Note**: When creating a new SAP object without prior motif detection, `summary = TRUE` 
will not add motif-bout relationship columns (n_motifs, align_time, etc.).

### Understanding SAP Object Behavior

The `find_bout()` function processes recordings based on the SAP object's metadata:

- **Lazy loading**: Audio files are read on-demand during processing
- **Centralized storage**: Results are stored in `sap$bouts`
- **Optional visualizations**: Set `save_plot = TRUE` to save detection plots
- **Parallel processing**: Uses multiple cores for efficient batch processing

### Example Output

```{r example-output, eval = FALSE}
# View bout detection summary
summary(sap$bouts)

# Example output:
#   filename        day_post_hatch label selec start_time end_time n_motifs
#   S237_190_1.wav  190           BL    1     2.45       8.32     12
#   S237_190_1.wav  190           BL    2     15.67      19.84    8
#   S237_201_1.wav  201           Post  1     3.21       10.45    15
```

When `summary = TRUE` is enabled with existing motif data, additional columns 
are included:

- `n_motifs`: Number of motifs detected within each bout
- `align_time`: Time of first motif (useful for alignment)
- `bout_number_day`: Sequential bout number within each day
- `bout_gap`: Time interval from previous bout (within same file)

### (Optional) Saving SAP Object

After completing bout detection, you can save the SAP object for later use:

```{r save-sap, eval = FALSE}
# Save the SAP object with bout detection results
saveRDS(sap, "longitudinal_bout_analysis.rds")

# Later, load it back
sap <- readRDS("longitudinal_bout_analysis.rds")
```

**What gets saved:**
- All metadata and file references
- Bout detection results
- Motif data (if previously detected)
- All spectral features and analysis results

**Important notes:**
- The original WAV files are **not** included in the saved object
- You must keep the WAV files at their original paths to run additional analyses
- The saved `.rds` file is typically much smaller than the audio data

## Visualizing Results

### Bout Spectrograms

Visualize sample bouts from each time point to verify detection quality:

```{r visualize, eval = FALSE}
# Visualize 3 random bouts per time point
visualize_segments(sap, segment_type = "bouts", n_samples = 3, by_column = TRUE)
```

![Sample Bouts Across Time Points](figures/longitudinal_bout_segments.png){width=100%}

### Amplitude Envelope Heatmap

Amplitude envelope heatmaps visualize the temporal structure of detected bouts 
across developmental stages.

```{r heatmap, eval = FALSE}
# Create amplitude envelope heatmap with balanced sampling
plot_heatmap(sap, segment_type = "bouts", balanced = TRUE)
```

![Bout Amplitude Envelope Heatmap](figures/longitudinal_bout_heatmap.png){width=70%}

**The `balanced` argument** ensures equal representation across time points (e.g., 
same number of bouts from each developmental stage), which improves statistical 
comparisons of bout structure across development.

## Bout Summary Statistics

### Understanding Summary Metrics

When `summary = TRUE` is enabled and motif data exists, `find_bout()` calculates 
additional metrics that reveal the relationship between bouts and motifs.

**Example bout summary table** (showing first 10 bouts):

![Bout Summary Statistics Table](figures/bout_summary_table.png){width=100%}

The table includes all detected bouts with the following columns:

- **`n_motifs`**: Count of motifs within each bout
  - Reveals motif density and bout complexity
  - Typically increases during song development
  
- **`align_time`**: Timestamp of first motif in bout
  - Useful for aligning bouts across recordings
  - Enables time-locked analysis of bout structure
  
- **`bout_number_day`**: Sequential bout number within each day
  - Tracks bout order within recording sessions
  - Useful for analyzing practice patterns
  
- **`bout_gap`**: Time interval from previous bout
  - Measures inter-bout intervals
  - Reveals temporal patterns in song production

### Interpreting Developmental Changes

Bout statistics can reveal important developmental patterns. The plots below show 
three key bout metrics across developmental stages:

![Developmental Trends in Bout Structure](figures/bout_developmental_trends.png){width=100%}

**Understanding the visualization**:

- **Boxplots** (colored boxes and whiskers):
  - **Box**: Middle 50% of data (interquartile range, IQR)
  - **Line in box**: Median value
  - **Whiskers**: Extend to 1.5× IQR or min/max values
  - **Small dots**: Individual outliers beyond whiskers
  
- **Red diamonds with error bars**:
  - **Diamond**: Mean (average) value
  - **Error bars**: Standard error of the mean (SEM = SD/√n)
  
- **Significance brackets** (if present):
  - Lines above boxes show significant pairwise differences
  - `*` p < 0.05, `**` p < 0.01, `***` p < 0.001

**Statistical Analysis**:

Non-parametric testing is used because temporal birdsong metrics often show skewed 
distributions and non-constant variance across development:

- **Kruskal-Wallis Test**: An overall test to determine if significant differences 
  exist across the three stages (**BL**, **Post**, **Rec**).
- **Pairwise Wilcoxon Tests**: Post-hoc comparisons to identify specific differences 
  between pairs of stages (e.g., comparing Baseline to Recovery).
- **Bonferroni Correction**: Applied to p-values to adjust for multiple comparisons 
  and prevent false discoveries.
- **Significance Markers**: Brackets and stars (`*`) in the plot indicate significant 
  pairwise differences based on these adjusted p-values.

**Key Metrics & Observed Trends**:

1. **Bout Duration (s)**: The total time from the start to the end of a detected bout.
   - **Observed Trend**: In this dataset, bout duration **decreases** significantly 
     across the three stages (**BL** > **Post** > **Rec**). This indicates shorter 
     vocal sequences as the experiment progresses.

2. **Inter-Bout Interval (s)**: The silent gap duration between consecutive bouts 
   within a recording session.
   - **Observed Trend**: In this dataset, the interval between bouts remains 
     **stable** across stages. No statistically significant changes were observed, 
     indicating that the timing between singing bouts was preserved despite 
     changes to the bouts themselves.

3. **Motifs per Bout**: The discrete count of motif renditions within a single bout.
   - **Observed Trend**: The number of motifs per bout **decreases** across stages. 
     Bouts become less dense with motifs, matching the overall reduction in 
     bout duration.

## Key Parameters for Bout Detection

Understanding and optimizing these parameters is crucial for accurate bout detection:

| Parameter | Description | Default | Optimization Tips |
|-----------|-------------|---------|-------------------|
| `rms_threshold` | Amplitude threshold for bout detection | 0.1 | **Lower** = more sensitive (detects quieter bouts)<br>**Higher** = more selective (only loud bouts)<br>Adjust based on recording quality and background noise |
| `min_duration` | Minimum bout duration (seconds) | 0.5 | Filter out brief vocalizations<br>Typical range: 0.4-0.7s<br>Shorter for juvenile birds, longer for adults |
| `gap_duration` | Minimum silence between bouts (seconds) | 0.3 | Defines bout boundaries<br>Typical: 0.3s<br>Longer gaps = fewer, longer bouts |
| `freq_range` | Bandpass filter range (kHz) | c(3, 5) | Focus on vocalization frequencies<br>Zebra finch: c(2, 8) or c(3, 5)<br>Adjust for species-specific frequencies |
| `edge_window` | Time window for edge effects (seconds) | 0.05 | Handles recording start artifacts<br>Rarely needs adjustment |
| `norm_method` | RMS normalization method | "quantile" | "quantile" = robust to outliers<br>"max" = sensitive to peaks |
| `summary` | Include motif-bout statistics | FALSE | Set TRUE when motif data exists<br>Adds n_motifs, align_time, bout_gap |
| `balanced` | Balance samples across time points | FALSE | Use TRUE for statistical comparisons<br>Ensures equal representation |
| `save_plot` | Save detection visualizations | FALSE | Set TRUE to review detection quality<br>Plots saved to base_path/plots/bout_detection/ |
| `plot_percent` | Percentage of files to plot | 10 | When save_plot = TRUE<br>10% provides good sampling |

## Tips for Longitudinal Bout Analysis

### 1. Optimize Parameters First

Test parameters on representative files from each time point before processing 
the entire dataset:

```{r optimize, eval = FALSE}
# Test on a single file
test_file <- file.path(sap$base_path, "190", sap$metadata$filename[1])

# Try different thresholds
bouts_low <- find_bout(test_file, rms_threshold = 0.05, plot = TRUE)
bouts_med <- find_bout(test_file, rms_threshold = 0.1, plot = TRUE)
bouts_high <- find_bout(test_file, rms_threshold = 0.15, plot = TRUE)

# Compare results
cat("Low threshold:", nrow(bouts_low), "bouts\n")
cat("Medium threshold:", nrow(bouts_med), "bouts\n")
cat("High threshold:", nrow(bouts_high), "bouts\n")
```

### 2. Check Detection Quality

Always visualize sample detections to verify bout boundaries are accurate:

```{r quality-check, eval = FALSE}
# Save plots for manual review
sap <- sap |>
  find_bout(
    min_duration = 0.4,
    save_plot = TRUE,
    plot_percent = 20  # Review 20% of files
  )

# Check plots in: base_path/plots/bout_detection/
```

### 3. Use Summary Statistics

Enable `summary = TRUE` when you have motif data to understand bout-motif 
relationships:

```{r use-summary, eval = FALSE}
# Requires existing motif detection
sap <- sap |>
  find_motif(template_name = "d", pre_time = 0.7, lag_time = 0.5) |>
  find_bout(min_duration = 0.4, summary = TRUE)

# Now you can analyze motif density in bouts
sap$bouts |>
  group_by(label) |>
  summarise(avg_motifs_per_bout = mean(n_motifs, na.rm = TRUE))
```

### 4. Balance Sampling for Comparisons

Use `balanced = TRUE` when creating visualizations or statistics for 
cross-timepoint comparisons:

```{r balance, eval = FALSE}
# Balanced heatmap for fair comparison
sap |> plot_heatmap(segment_type = "bouts", balanced = TRUE)

# Balanced sampling for analysis
balanced_bouts <- select_segments(
  sap$bouts,
  balanced = TRUE
)
```

### 5. Consider Recording Quality

Adjust parameters based on recording conditions:

- **High background noise**: Increase `rms_threshold`, adjust `freq_range`
- **Variable amplitude**: Use `norm_method = "quantile"`
- **Short recordings**: Decrease `min_duration` to capture all bouts
- **Continuous singing**: Increase `gap_duration` to separate bouts
