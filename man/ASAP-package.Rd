\title{ASAP: Automated Sound Analysis Pipeline for Avian Vocalization Research}
\description{
A comprehensive toolkit for longitudinal analysis of birdsong development. ASAP provides an integrated suite of tools for processing, analyzing, and visualizing avian vocalizations, with particular emphasis on zebra finch song recordings from SAP2011. The package implements automated workflows for bout detection, motif extraction, syllable segmentation, template matching, temporal and spectral feature extraction, enabling researchers to track subtle changes in vocal patterns across developmental time points. Through efficient parallel processing and standardized analytical approaches, ASAP facilitates large-scale longitudinal studies of song learning and development, offering researchers powerful tools for quantifying vocal plasticity and investigating the mechanisms of vocal learning in songbirds.
