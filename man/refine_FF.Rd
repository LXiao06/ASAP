\arguments{
\item{x}{A Sap object containing fundamental frequency and pitch goodness data}

\item{segment_type}{Character, type of segment to analyze: "motifs", "syllables", or "segments"}

\item{reference_label}{Character, label to use as reference for template creation}

\item{method}{Character, method for template creation: "quantile" or "hmm"}

\item{minimal_duration}{Numeric, minimum duration (in ms) for valid segments}

\item{split_dips}{Logical, whether to split segments at significant dips in goodness}

\item{quantile_threshold}{Numeric, threshold for quantile method (0-1). Controls sensitivity of
pitch detection - higher values (e.g., 0.7) retain only high-quality regions,
lower values (e.g., 0.3) include more regions but may introduce noise}

\item{hmm_trans_prob}{Numeric, transition probability for HMM method (0-1). Controls
state persistence - higher values (e.g., 0.95) create fewer, longer segments;
lower values (e.g., 0.8) create more, shorter segments}

\item{random_seed}{Numeric, seed for reproducibility}

\item{plot}{Logical, whether to plot the results}

\item{plot_freq_lim}{Numeric vector of length 2, frequency limits for plotting}

\item{color_palette}{Function, color palette for plotting}

\item{stats}{Logical, whether to calculate segment statistics}

\item{verbose}{Logical, whether to print access information}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to plotting functions}

\value{
Invisibly returns the modified Sap object with refined fundamental frequency data
}
\description{
Refines fundamental frequency detection by identifying regions of reliable pitch tracking
using various methods and applying temporal constraints.
}
\details{
The function uses either quantile-based thresholding or Hidden Markov Models to identify
regions of reliable pitch tracking. It can optionally split segments at local minima in
pitch goodness and applies minimum duration constraints.
\subsection{Method Selection}{
\itemize{
\item \strong{Quantile method}: Simple thresholding based on pitch goodness values. Works well
for clean recordings with good signal-to-noise ratio.
\item \strong{HMM method}: Uses a Hidden Markov Model to identify segments. More robust to
noise and can better detect natural boundaries in the signal.
}
}

\subsection{Parameter Selection Guidelines}{
\subsection{Quantile Threshold (quantile_threshold)}{
\itemize{
\item \strong{0.3-0.4}: Liberal threshold that includes most pitch-tracked regions. Use for high-quality recordings
where you want to maximize data retention.
\item \strong{0.5-0.6}: Balanced threshold (default). Works well for most recordings.
\item \strong{0.7-0.8}: Conservative threshold that only includes regions with very reliable pitch tracking.
Use for noisy recordings where precision is more important than recall.
}
}

\subsection{HMM Transition Probability (hmm_trans_prob)}{
\itemize{
\item \strong{0.8-0.85}: Creates more responsive segmentation with shorter segments. Use when analyzing
rapid vocalizations with frequent transitions.
\item \strong{0.9}: Balanced setting (default). Works well for most vocalizations.
\item \strong{0.95-0.98}: Creates more stable segmentation with fewer, longer segments. Use for
sustained vocalizations or when you want to minimize over-segmentation.

\note{
The HMM method requires the 'depmixS4' package to be installed.
