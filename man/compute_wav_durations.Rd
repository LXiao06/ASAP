\title{Compute WAV File Durations}
\usage{
compute_wav_durations(x, cores = NULL, verbose = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A SAP object containing metadata and base path to audio files}

\item{cores}{Number of cores to use for parallel processing (NULL for auto-detection: total cores - 1)}

\item{verbose}{Logical flag to control progress messages and warnings (default: TRUE)}
}
\value{
Returns the modified SAP object with added duration column in metadata containing
wave file durations in seconds. Missing files will have NA durations.
}
\description{
Calculates durations for all WAV files referenced in a SAP object's metadata
using parallel processing. Handles missing files gracefully by returning NA
durations and providing warnings.
}
\details{
Key features:
\itemize{
\item Parallel processing implementation using \code{parallel_apply}
\item Automatic core detection with fallback to single-core processing
\item Progress tracking and missing file warnings
\item Preserves original object structure while adding duration information
}
}
