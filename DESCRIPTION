Description: A comprehensive toolkit for longitudinal analysis of birdsong 
    development. ASAP provides an integrated suite of tools for processing, 
    analyzing, and visualizing avian vocalizations, with particular emphasis 
    on zebra finch song recordings from SAP2011. The package implements 
    automated workflows for bout detection, motif extraction, syllable 
    segmentation, template matching, temporal and spectral feature extraction, 
    enabling researchers to track subtle changes in vocal patterns across 
    developmental time points. Through efficient parallel processing and 
    standardized analytical approaches, ASAP facilitates large-scale 
    longitudinal studies of song learning and development, offering researchers 
    powerful tools for quantifying vocal plasticity and investigating the 
    mechanisms of vocal learning in songbirds.
